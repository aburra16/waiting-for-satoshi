                         CAST OF CHARACTERS
                         ___________________

GIOVANNI : late-forties family man.  Worn shoes, loyal heart, quick wit.
MAXIMILIAN : late-forties itinerant artist.  Scuffed boots, wild ideas.


SETTING:  A public park.  Autumn afternoon straight through dusk.
TIME:     The present — exactly twenty-one years after their first “wait.”





                         _ONE  ACT_   (no intermission)

            (Late afternoon.  A wooden bench beneath a red-leafed maple.
            GIOVANNI sits; tie loosened, laptop bag at his feet.
            MAXIMILIAN sprawls; paint-spattered satchel and sketchbook.)

                         MAXIMILIAN
You honestly think that’s a good life? … fleeting, vacuous relationships …
there is no meaning or purpose to my life.  It’s incredibly lonely and empty.

                         (The men sit in silence.  A breeze rustles the maple.
                         GIOVANNI scratches his beard; MAXIMILIAN kicks at a pebble.)

                         GIOVANNI
            (gently)
Well, then—good.  We’ve established that you envy my chaos and I envy your
freedom.  A perfectly balanced misery.  Shall we go home?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (startled)
Go home?  We can’t go home, Gio!  We’re waiting for Satoshi.

                         GIOVANNI
Ah yes, him again.  The invisible handyman of the cosmos.  Tell me—will he
also fix Cassandra’s leaking dishwasher, or only the metaphysical plumbing?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Everything.  When he comes, prices will make sense, paychecks will stretch,
and your dishwasher will sing like an operetta.

                         GIOVANNI
            (snorts)
Have you bought groceries this week?  Bread is twice what it was last year.
My paycheck, meanwhile, is the same shrivelled raisin.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Exactly!  That’s why we need him.  Satoshi will set the numbers straight—
no more arbitrary expansion of whatever it is they expand.

                         GIOVANNI
You mean the currency?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (claps hands over his ears)
Shh!  You’ll summon auditors.  Just call it “the ever-swelling soufflé.”
Satoshi will pop it and serve us something firm—something that holds its shape.

                         GIOVANNI
            (dry)
Ah, a firm pudding.  Delicious.  And what shall we do while we wait for
dessert?  The electric company raised rates again.  I may have to choose
between lights and socks.

                         MAXIMILIAN
I haven’t owned matching socks in years.  It’s terribly chic in Paris.

                         GIOVANNI
This isn’t Paris; it’s Peoria with delusions of grandeur.  Chic here is
buying two ounces of cheese without taking out a loan.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (taps temple)
Think bigger: barter art for cheese, cheese for candles, candles for…
more art.  A graceful circle.

                         GIOVANNI
Until the cheese spoils and the candles melt.  Circles are overrated.  I
want a straight line from work to worth.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Lines are brittle.  Circles bend.  Satoshi is a circle made of straight
lines—trust me.

                         GIOVANNI
Stop speaking in geometry.  Last night my eldest asked if we could start
growing our own bread.  “From what?” I said.  “Dirt?”

                         MAXIMILIAN
Marvelous initiative!  Soil-to-sandwich—the next foodie trend.

                         GIOVANNI
We’d need seeds, water, and a twelve-month head start.  By the time it’s
baked the price will have doubled again.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (sighs)
Yesterday I paid thirteen units for a single black coffee.

                         GIOVANNI
Units?  They’ve renamed the coin again?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Re-denominated, re-imagined, re-diculous.  They moved the decimal place to
make us feel wealthier.

                         GIOVANNI
Did it work?

                         MAXIMILIAN
For six glorious minutes.  Then the pastry case adjusted.

                         GIOVANNI
And Satoshi will un-adjust it?

                         MAXIMILIAN
No.  He’ll make adjusting impossible.  Imagine a scale nobody can tamper
with—goods stay honest, numbers behave.

                         GIOVANNI
Like my grandfather’s brass scale.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Exactly!  Only invisible and everywhere.  Brass in cyberspace.

                         GIOVANNI
            (rubs temples)
I’m too old for invisible brass.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Tell Cassandra to hold fast.  Relief is en route—on horseback, perhaps, or
via peer-to-peer teleportation.

                         GIOVANNI
            (laughs despite himself)
Peer-to-peer teleportation.  Excellent.
            (beat)
But what if he never comes?  What if the bench swallows us and our children
inherit only splinters?

                         MAXIMILIAN
He’ll come.

                         GIOVANNI
You said that last year.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (sheepish)
True.

                         GIOVANNI
And the nineteen years before that.

                         MAXIMILIAN
I’m nothing if not consistent.

            (They share a wistful smile.)

                         GIOVANNI
Let’s change the subject before I pawn my wedding ring for bread.  Tell me,
worldly wanderer—what have you learned about the meaning of life?

                         MAXIMILIAN
The meaning of life?  Easy.  It’s art.  And love.  And sunrise on wet
cobblestones.  And also a decent espresso.

                         GIOVANNI
            (counts fingers)
Art, love, sunrise, espresso.  You forgot taxes, dental cleanings, and
teenagers.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Those are the tests.  Pass them, and you unlock the espresso.

                         GIOVANNI
My teenagers drank the espresso and left me the tests.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (laughing)
Then you, my friend, are living the advanced curriculum.

                         GIOVANNI
If this is advanced, I’d like remedial.
            (He sighs, then grows quiet.)
Max… do you ever fear we’re spectators in our own stories?  Always waiting
for the next act, never stepping onstage?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (softly)
Every day.

            (Long pause.  A distant church bell marks the hour.)

                         GIOVANNI
Twenty-one years.  In that time they built three museums, each uglier than
the last.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Aesthetic ebb and flow.  First, builders soared—arches, columns, domes.
Then came rebels: angled walls, melted clocks, lampposts wearing bowler hats.

                         GIOVANNI
I liked the lampposts.

                         MAXIMILIAN
So did I.  Rebellion with a wink.  But lately?  Boxes on boxes, grey on
greyer, beauty bulldozed in daylight.

                         GIOVANNI
It’s as if the city ran out of pigment.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Or courage.  They smashed the frame but never rebuilt the canvas.  All splash,
no soul.

                         GIOVANNI
So what’s next?  We can’t loop forever from ornate to obscene.

                         MAXIMILIAN
We won’t.  The pendulum pauses, finds a midpoint.  Craft returns, free of
rules yet hungry for grace.

                         GIOVANNI
Midpoint craft.  Sounds like woodworking class.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (grins)
Exactly!  Only with skyscrapers.  Imagine steel that curves like a violin,
glass that catches dawn and breaks it into hymns.  No priest with a ruler,
no critic with a sledgehammer—just pure pursuit.

                         GIOVANNI
And Satoshi funds this?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Not funds—enables.  When value rests on bedrock, patrons sprout like
dandelions.  Artists stop begging, start building.

                         GIOVANNI
You paint a lovely future.  Pity we’re stuck in plywood present.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Then let’s whittle.  You sketch, I sand.  When the tide turns, we’ll already
be afloat.

                         GIOVANNI
I haven’t sketched since college.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Your pencil remembers.  Trust the graphite.

                         GIOVANNI
Honest measure… You sound like my grandfather weighing apples on a brass
scale.

                         MAXIMILIAN
He was ahead of his time.  Imagine painters paid in something that can’t be
diluted, buildings funded without hidden termites of inflation.  That’s the
new era.

                         GIOVANNI
Bold vision, Max.  Meanwhile, Cassandra texts me the price of olive oil.  She
attaches a crying-face emoji.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Satoshi will sort the pantry soon enough.

                         GIOVANNI
            (looks at sky)
But what if he never comes?  Truly?  What if the messenger lost our address?
What if—
            (voice cracks)
What if there is no messenger?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (rises, alarmed)
There must be.  Otherwise—

                         GIOVANNI
Otherwise we waited for nothing.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (almost whispers)
Or we waited for ourselves.

            (Silence.  The park seems to hold its breath.)

                         GIOVANNI
            (slowly)
Explain.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Maybe… maybe Satoshi is a mirror.  We look into the myth until we finally
see our own faces staring back.

                         GIOVANNI
I never liked mirrors.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Nor I.  But consider: your longing for creative purpose, my craving for
home—what if he isn’t bringing those gifts?  What if he’s been waiting for
us to give them to each other?

                         GIOVANNI
            (half-laugh)
You mean—I teach you how to file taxes, and you teach me how to paint?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Precisely.  Mutual aid, self-sovereignty, all that jazz.

                         GIOVANNI
            (rolls idea on his tongue)
Self-sovereignty.  Sounds expensive.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Cheaper than perpetual hope deferred.

            (A flock of pigeons lifts behind them, startling both.)

                         GIOVANNI
Max?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Yes?

                         GIOVANNI
Say it with me.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (heart pounding)
Say what?

                         GIOVANNI
The thing we’re both afraid of.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (nods, breathes)
All right.
            (They lock eyes, speak in unison.)
He isn’t coming.

            (The words echo.  Nothing happens—no thunderbolt, no trumpet.
            Just relief.)

                         GIOVANNI
            (a grin blooming)
We survived.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (laughter bubbles up)
Feels… light, doesn’t it?

                         GIOVANNI
Weightless.
            (He looks at his hands, astonished.)
Max, I think my shoulders just resigned.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Mine too!
            (beat)
So what now?

                         GIOVANNI
We could stay and wait for someone else.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Terrible idea.

                         GIOVANNI
Agreed.
            (He glances at the horizon—first hint of sunset.)
Let’s go home.  Or better—let’s build a home where art pays the bills and
bills respect art.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (eyes shining)
A midpoint craft—for real.

                         GIOVANNI
            (extends hand)
Partner?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (clasps it)
Partner.

            (They take one step away from the bench, then halt.)

                         GIOVANNI
One more thing.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Yes?

                         GIOVANNI
            (soft, certain)
I am Satoshi.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (smiles)
And so am I.

            (They nod, turn, and stride offstage side by side, leaving the
            bench empty under the red maple.)

                         (BLACKOUT)

                         (END OF PLAY)
```
