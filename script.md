                      CAST OF CHARACTERS
                      ___________________

GIOVANNI : A 42-year-old married man with teenage children.
MAXIMILIAN : A 42-year-old single man and childhood friend of Giovanni’s.

SETTING : A well-maintained park in an upscale neighborhood of an undisclosed town.  
TIME    : The near future — exactly twenty-one years after their first “wait.”



ACT 1

Scene 1

SETTING:
We are in a well-maintained park in an upscale neighborhood of an undisclosed
town. There is a bench under a red maple tree.

AT RISE:
GIOVANNI is sitting on the left side of the bench as you face it, and MAXIMILIAN
is sitting on the right. The two men are childhood friends, and as their lives
have diverged with adulthood, they’ve made it a point to meet once a year on this
very park bench, to catch up on the events of the year. This is one such meeting.



                         GIOVANNI
Here we are again, old friend.  Another year goes by in the blink of an eye,
and I’m older, but none the wiser.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Oh, come now, Giovanni.  Surely you learned something new this past year.

                         GIOVANNI
            (sighs)
My dear Maximilian, we are both now at an age when there’s nothing new under
the sun.  What is there to my life, anyway?  I wake up, drop the kids off at
school, go to work with people I don’t particularly care for, doing things
that suck the soul out of me, end up at the pub with those very same vapid
people, and then head back to a home where my wife starts nagging me with
her new pet peeve, and my children complain about how their lives are lacking
the latest consumer good they heard about in their Snapchat group.  It takes
every ounce of strength I have left in me to resolve all of that without
losing it on them.  At least that way, I can fall asleep without people
screaming around me.  Every single weekday is the same.

            (MAXIMILIAN chuckles.)

                         MAXIMILIAN
At least you have the weekends to look forward to.

            (GIOVANNI scoffs.)

                         GIOVANNI
Weekends?  Don’t talk to me about weekends!  That’s when I’m an unpaid
chauffeur, shuttling my kids to their various activities, pretending to
make polite conversation with the other parents there, listening to them
brag about their kids’ achievements, and occasionally talking about some
stupid sports-ball game they saw.  How are any of these people real?
Do they not have meaningful interests?  How can their lives revolve around
their kids’ activities and major-league sports?  What about creativity?
What about passion?  What about building something that makes the world a
better place?

            (He sighs deeply and stares ponderously into the distance.)

I’m one to talk, though.  Look at me.  That’s my life too, isn’t it?
What am I creating?  What am I building?  Nothing.  I’m just like them.
Maybe I should just accept it.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (very quietly)
Do you know what I’d accept in a heartbeat?  A door that clicks shut behind
me at night and opens to little voices shouting “Daddy!”  I spend evenings
in hotel rooms where the mini-bar hums louder than my own thoughts.

                         GIOVANNI
That’s not envy talking, just jet-lag.  Wait until one of those little voices
throws a half-eaten yogurt at your head because it’s the wrong flavor.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Luxury!  An airborne dairy product implies a refrigerator, a routine, a
reason.  Last month in Caiscais I awoke at noon, stared at the ceiling, and
asked myself, “Am I breakfast, or am I dinner running late?”

                         GIOVANNI
You, my friend, are brunch - pretentious, over-priced, and served with a tiny
umbrella.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (laughs, then softens)
But brunch alone grows stale.  You say Cassandra nags... fine.  My last steady
conversation was with an airline chatbot named L.U.C.Y.  At least Cassandra
argues in complete sentences.

                         GIOVANNI
Her sentences are complete; my patience is not.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Still, she is sentence... subject, verb, object, purpose.  Purpose is gravity.
Without it, my feet drift.  Museums, festivals... brilliant on paper, but when
I win an award there’s no one in the audience mouthing “That’s my guy!”

                         GIOVANNI
            (teasing)
You could marry L.U.C.Y.  She already knows your seat preference.

                         MAXIMILIAN
She denies me leg-room upgrades. Clearly a doomed romance.
            (beat)
Gio, I love the wind at my back, but sometimes I envy the roof over yours.

                         GIOVANNI
And I envy your sky.  Perhaps we should trade a shingle for a breeze.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (smiles)
We will... when he arrives bearing deeds and parachutes.

            (MAXIMILIAN looks at GIOVANNI kindly.)

                         MAXIMILIAN
You do know, we *are* waiting for...

                         GIOVANNI
            (earnestly)
Yes, yes, I know.  We’re waiting for him, and he’s going to set us free.
Yes, I do believe that.  But sometimes I do wonder, Max.  Do you realize
this is the twenty-first year we’re meeting here on this very bench?  You
left to travel the world when we were both twenty-one, and that’s when we
made our pact to meet here once a year.  We’re forty-two now.  We’ve been
waiting for him to come and fix everything ever since then.  Well, where is
he?

                         MAXIMILIAN
All I know is that he’s coming.  He’s coming this year, Gio, I can feel it.
And once he’s here, he’s going to show us the way.  Everything we’ve found
lacking in our lives, he will set right.  We will experience a joy and
freedom that we’ve only dreamed of.

                         GIOVANNI
            (stares at MAXIMILIAN skeptically)
What’s lacking in your life, anyway?  You got to pursue your dreams, you
studied the arts, you became an actor, then a playwright.  You travel the
world as a judge at film festivals.  You spend your time with painters and
poets.  You don’t have a family that depends on you and makes constant
claims to your time and attention when all you want is to be left alone to
your thoughts.  You’re already free, Max, don’t you realize that?  You don’t
need Satoshi.  I’m the only one waiting for him.

                         MAXIMILIAN
You honestly think that’s a good life? … fleeting, vacuous relationships …
there is no meaning or purpose to my life.  It’s incredibly lonely and empty.

                         GIOVANNI
            (sharp)
Oh, spare me the “lonely artist.”  You chose that.  You buy a ticket, you
take the ride.  Nobody forces you to stare at masterpieces in silence; that’s
a luxury item.  My life isn’t a luxury. It's a subscription service with no
cancel button.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (defensive)
And you think I don’t pay?  My subscription is the phone that never rings
unless it’s a gallery chasing a sale.  Your phone rings; people need you.
That has value.

                         GIOVANNI
            (frustrated)
No, Max.  They don’t need *me*. They need a driver, a wallet, a handyman.
You’re not lonely for people; you’re lonely for purpose.  I’m drowning in it.
You can’t drink purpose!

            (The men sit in silence.  A breeze rustles the maple.
             GIOVANNI scratches his beard; MAXIMILIAN kicks at a pebble.)

                         GIOVANNI
            (gently)
Well, then, good.  We’ve established that you envy my chaos and I envy your
freedom.  A perfectly balanced misery.  Shall we go home?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (startled)
Go home?  We can’t go home, Gio!  We’re waiting for Satoshi.

                         GIOVANNI
Ah yes, him again.  The invisible handyman of the cosmos.  Tell me, will he
also fix Cassandra’s leaking dishwasher, or only the metaphysical plumbing?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Everything.  When he comes, prices will make sense, paychecks will stretch,
and your dishwasher will sing like an operetta.

                         GIOVANNI
            (snorts)
Have you bought groceries this week?  Bread is twice what it was last year.
My paycheck, meanwhile, is the same shriveled raisin.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Exactly!  That’s why we need him.  Satoshi will set the numbers straight -
no more arbitrary expansion of whatever it is they expand.

                         GIOVANNI
You mean the currency?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (claps hands over his ears)
Shh!  You’ll summon auditors.  Just call it “the ever-swelling soufflé.”
Satoshi will pop it and serve us something firm... something that holds its shape.

                         GIOVANNI
            (dry)
Ah, a firm pudding.  Delicious.  And what shall we do while we wait for
dessert?  The electric company raised rates again.  I may have to choose
between lights and socks.

                         MAXIMILIAN
I haven’t owned matching socks in years.  It’s terribly chic in Paris.

                         GIOVANNI
This isn’t Paris; it’s Peoria with delusions of grandeur.  Chic here is
buying two ounces of cheese without taking out a loan.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (taps temple)
Think bigger: barter art for cheese, cheese for candles, candles for...
more art.  A graceful circle.

                         GIOVANNI
Until the cheese spoils and the candles melt.  Circles are overrated.  I
want a straight line from work to worth.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Lines are brittle.  Circles bend.  Satoshi is a circle made of straight
lines, trust me.

                         GIOVANNI
Stop speaking in geometry.  Last night my eldest asked if we could start
growing our own bread.  “From what?” I said.  “Dirt?”

                         MAXIMILIAN
Marvelous initiative!  Soil-to-sandwich—the next foodie trend.

                         GIOVANNI
We’d need seeds, water, and a twelve-month head start.  By the time it’s
baked the price will have doubled again.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (sighs)
Yesterday I paid thirteen units for a single black coffee.

                         GIOVANNI
Units?  They’ve renamed the coin again?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Re-denominated, re-imagined, re-diculous.  They moved the decimal place to
make us feel wealthier.

                         GIOVANNI
Did it work?

                         MAXIMILIAN
For six glorious minutes.  Then the pastry case adjusted.

                         GIOVANNI
And Satoshi will un-adjust it?

                         MAXIMILIAN
No.  He’ll make adjusting impossible.  Imagine a scale nobody can tamper
with... goods stay honest, numbers behave.

                         GIOVANNI
Like my grandfather’s brass scale.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Exactly!  Only invisible and everywhere.  Brass in cyberspace.

                         GIOVANNI
            (rubs temples)
I’m too old for invisible brass.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (reaches into jacket)
Maybe brass is invisible, but paper isn’t.
            (He unfolds a creased bill.)

                         GIOVANNI
The ten-million lira note.  My God... I haven’t seen one in years.  It’s
worthless now; you could use it as a bookmark.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Not worthless.  A reminder.  This was their first move, remember?  “Take
away the zeroes and everyone gets richer.”

                         GIOVANNI
And for a week we believed them.  Coffee cost ten lira instead of ten
thousand.  We walked around like kings.

                         MAXIMILIAN
We were fools.  They didn’t erase zeroes; they erased memory.  They taught us
that value is whatever they declare.  This note is our testament. The first
line in the story of why we wait.  It says, “Never again.”

                         GIOVANNI
            (takes the bill, feels the fragile paper)
To me it says something else now, Max.  It says, “Paper is paper.”  We sit
here dreaming of invisible brass while they’re still printing this stuff - 
just with fresh pictures.  Maybe we’re the last two men alive who remember
what it felt like to hold zeroes in our hands.

                         MAXIMILIAN
In any event, tell Cassandra to hold fast.  Relief is en route, on horseback, 
perhaps, or via peer-to-peer teleportation.

                         GIOVANNI
            (laughs despite himself)
Peer-to-peer teleportation.  Excellent.
            (pulls phone out of his pocket and glances at it)
Speaking of Cassandra, she just texted me. Probably forgot that today was our 
annual meeting and thinks I'm drunk at a pub somewhere.
            (beat)
But what if Satoshi never comes?  What if the bench swallows us and our children
inherit only splinters?

                         GIOVANNI
You know what I thought about last night?  What if he came, but it was
            (leans closer, conspiratorial)
an email.  An email from a no-reply address.  We missed it.  It went to spam.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Spam?  The genesis of a new world, filtered out by an algorithm hunting
misspelled words?  Don’t be absurd.  His arrival would be a sign... a universal
            (searches for the word)
feeling.

                         GIOVANNI
            (warming to the game, pantomimes typing)
No, it’s an email!  Subject line: “Project Satoshi - Go Live.”  And there’s a
link.  You click it, Max, and it whisks you to a government-looking portal
with a thousand page terms-of-service agreement.  Do you accept?  Do you
bind your soul to the digital future without reading the fine print?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (playing along, anxious)
Is there a search bar?  Can I search for the word “freedom”?  Or “art”?

                         GIOVANNI
You can!  You scroll and discover Section 21B, subsection C:  
“*Art is permitted, provided it does not disrupt market stability.*”
Your first painting in the brave new world, and it’s flagged by a bot for
being “economically volatile.”  What do you do then?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (drops the act, sober)
We’re waiting for a revolution, Gio, not a software update.
	    (beat)
He’ll come.

                         GIOVANNI
You said that last year.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (sheepish)
True.

                         GIOVANNI
And the nineteen years before that.

                         MAXIMILIAN
I’m nothing if not consistent.

            (They share a wistful smile.)

                         MAXIMILIAN
We’re not like them, Gio. Never. Remember Martin Zuckergast?

                         GIOVANNI
            (snorts)
Martin. Of course I remember. Saw him last Christmas. Drives a German car the
color of money. His children have names that sound like mutual funds.

                         MAXIMILIAN
And is he happy?

                         GIOVANNI
He’s… loud. He speaks of his portfolio the way we once spoke of changing the
world. He called our waiting “poor asset allocation.” Then he laughed.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Let him laugh. His foundation is sand; the tide is coming.

                         GIOVANNI
Is it, Max? Or did Martin simply learn to swim while we’ve been sitting here,
waiting for a boat?
	    (beat)
Anyway, enough about flotation devices.  If I dwell on Martin any longer, I’ll start
appraising this bench for scrap value.  Tell me, worldly wanderer, what have 
you learned about the meaning of life in the year gone by?

                         MAXIMILIAN
The meaning of life?  Easy.  It’s art.  The pursuit of beauty. And love.
And sunrise on wet cobblestones.  And also a decent espresso.

                         GIOVANNI
            (counts fingers)
Art, love, beauty, sunrise, espresso.  You forgot taxes, dental cleanings, and
teenagers.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Those are the tests.  Pass them, and you unlock the espresso.

                         GIOVANNI
My teenagers drank the espresso and left me the tests.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (laughing)
Then you, my friend, are living the advanced curriculum.

                         GIOVANNI
If this is advanced, I’d like remedial.
            (He sighs, then grows quiet.)
Max... do you ever fear we’re spectators in our own stories?  Always waiting
for the next act, never stepping onstage?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (softly)
Every day.

            (Long pause.  A distant church bell marks the hour.)

                         GIOVANNI
Twenty-one years.  In that time they built three museums, each uglier than
the last.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Aesthetic ebb and flow.  First, builders soared - arches, columns, domes.
Then came rebels: angled walls, melted clocks, lampposts wearing bowler hats.

                         GIOVANNI
I liked the lampposts.

                         MAXIMILIAN
So did I.  Rebellion with a wink.  But lately?  Boxes on boxes, grey on
greyer, beauty bulldozed in daylight.

                         GIOVANNI
It’s as if the city ran out of pigment.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Or courage.  They smashed the frame but never rebuilt the canvas.  All splash,
no soul.

                         GIOVANNI
So what’s next?  We can’t loop forever from ornate to obscene.

                         MAXIMILIAN
We won’t.  The pendulum pauses, finds a midpoint.  Craft returns, free of
rules yet hungry for grace.

                         GIOVANNI
Midpoint craft.  Sounds like woodworking class.
                         MAXIMILIAN
            (grins)
Exactly!  Only with skyscrapers.  Imagine steel that curves like a violin,
glass that catches dawn and breaks it into hymns.  No priest with a ruler,
no critic with a sledgehammer... just pure pursuit.

                         GIOVANNI
So.  Any signs?

                         MAXIMILIAN
The signs are present.

                         GIOVANNI
As they were last year.  Name one.

                         MAXIMILIAN
The architects have run out of ideas.
            (He gestures vaguely toward the skyline.)

                         GIOVANNI
A sure sign.  And?

                         MAXIMILIAN
A poet in Lisbon paid for his wine with a song.

                         GIOVANNI
            (dry)
The bartender was tone-deaf and the wine was sour.  And the most important sign?

                         MAXIMILIAN
We are still here.

                         GIOVANNI
            (sighs, then looks out across the park)
Yes.  We are still here.
            (beat)
So—back to your steel violins and glass hymns.  Satoshi funds this?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Not funds. Enables.  When value rests on bedrock, when we have an honest
measure, patrons sprout like dandelions.  Artists stop begging, start
building.

                         GIOVANNI
You paint a lovely future.  Pity we’re stuck in plywood present.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Then let’s whittle.  You sketch, I sand.  When the tide turns, we’ll already
be afloat.

                         GIOVANNI
I haven’t sketched since college.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Your pencil remembers.  Trust the graphite.

                         GIOVANNI
Honest measure... You sound like my grandfather weighing apples on his brass
scale.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Ah, there's that famous brass scale again. Well, he was ahead of his time.
Imagine painters paid in something that can’t be diluted, buildings funded
without hidden termites of inflation.  That’s the new era.

                         GIOVANNI
Bold vision, Max.  Meanwhile, Cassandra texts me the price of olive oil.  She
attaches a crying-face emoji.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Satoshi will sort the pantry soon enough.

                         GIOVANNI
            (looks at sky)
But what if he never comes?  Truly?  What if the messenger lost our address?
What if...
            (voice cracks)
What if there is no messenger?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (rises, alarmed)
There must be.  Otherwise...

                         GIOVANNI
Otherwise we waited for nothing.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (almost whispers)
Or we waited for ourselves.

            (Silence.  The park seems to hold its breath.)

                         GIOVANNI
            (slowly)
Explain.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (slowly at first, then increasingly excitedly)
Maybe... maybe, we were wrong all this while, Gio. All these years, we've been
waiting for an external savior... waiting for permission from some nebulous someone
to truly live our lives. What if Satoshi is a mirror?  We stare into the myth until
we finally see our own faces staring back.

                         GIOVANNI
I never liked mirrors.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Nor I.  But consider: your longing for creative purpose, my craving for
home... what if he isn’t bringing those gifts?  What if he’s been waiting for
us to give them to each other?

                         GIOVANNI
            (half-laugh)
You mean, I teach you how to file taxes, and you teach me how to paint?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Precisely.  Mutual aid, self-sovereignty, all that jazz.

                         GIOVANNI
            (rolls idea on his tongue)
Self-sovereignty.  Sounds expensive.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (pointedly)
Cheaper than perpetual hope deferred.

            (A flock of pigeons lifts behind them, startling both.)

                         GIOVANNI
Max?

                         MAXIMILIAN
Yes?

                         GIOVANNI
Say it with me.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (heart pounding)
Say what?

                         GIOVANNI
The thing we’re both afraid of.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (nods, breathes)
All right.
            (They lock eyes, speak in unison.)
He isn’t coming.

            (The words echo.  Nothing happens. No thunderbolt, no trumpet.
            Just relief.)

                         GIOVANNI
            (a grin blooming)
We survived.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (laughter bubbles up)
Feels... light, doesn’t it?

                         GIOVANNI
Weightless.
            (He looks at his hands, astonished.)
Max, I think my shoulders just resigned.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Mine too!
            (beat)
So what now?

                         GIOVANNI
We could stay and wait for someone else.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Terrible idea.

                         GIOVANNI
Agreed.
            (He glances at the horizon—first hint of sunset.)
Let’s go home.  Or better, let’s build a home where art pays the bills and
bills respect art. 

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (eyes shining)
A midpoint craft, for real.

                         GIOVANNI
            (extends hand)
Partner?

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (clasps it)
Partner.

            (They take one step away from the bench, then halt.)

                         GIOVANNI
One more thing.

                         MAXIMILIAN
Yes?

                         GIOVANNI
            (soft, certain)
I am Satoshi.

                         MAXIMILIAN
            (smiles)
And so am I.

            (They nod, turn, and stride offstage side by side, leaving the
            bench empty under the red maple.)

                         (BLACKOUT)

                         (END OF PLAY)
```
